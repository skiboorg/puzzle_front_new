<p><span lang="en-US">- Each level has its own time to collect - the more difficult the level, the more time and points are given.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">- If you have collected the selected level correctly and on time, an inscription will appear on the playing field &ldquo;YOU WON&rdquo; and you will receive points in RATING, if you could not collect it in time, the inscription &ldquo;YOU LOSE&rdquo; will appear, then you have the opportunity to collect any level again ...</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-US">5. When registering and replenishing BALANCE:</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">- from 500 to 50,000 YUAN (from 70 to 7000 USD) for each correct collection of QR-ART Puzzle, your RATING will receive from 2 to 6 points and when you reach 200 points per month, your BALANCE will increase by 8%.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">6. The number of games in one day is 5, the number of points in RATING per month is not less than 200. Your points in RATING are reset to zero every 1st day of a new month.</span></p>
