				<p>1. It is necessary to correctly assemble QR-ART Puzzle of one of three levels:</p>
				<p>- Choose one of the levels, click on it and get the elements scattered across the field.</p>
				<p>- Move the cursor over any element, grab it and, while holding it, bring it to any other element, if any of the sides of these elements coincide, then they will connect to each other.</p>
				<p>- By the method of subsequent selection of elements, with the correct option, they all connect and form a single QR-ART Puzzle.</p>
				<p>- Each level has its own time to collect - the more difficult the level, the more time and points are given.</p>
				<p>- If you have collected the selected level correctly and on time, an inscription will appear on the playing field “YOU WON” and you will receive points in RATING, if you could not collect it in time, the inscription “YOU LOSE” will appear, then you have the opportunity to collect any level again ...</p>
				<p>It is imperative to watch the advertisement.</p>
				<p>2. All settlements are carried out in local currency - QR (1 QR = 1 YUAN), the funds transferred by you will be converted into QR-currency, and when funds are withdrawn to your account, they will be converted back.</p>
				<p>3. Without registration:</p>
				<p>- you can train at all three levels in DEMO, but if you collect correctly, QR-ART Puzzle RATING and BALANCE will not be replenished.</p>
				<p>4. After registration, but without replenishment of BALANCE:</p>
				<p>- we present to your BALANCE 1000 YUAN = 1000 QR, which you cannot withdraw, but you can transfer all the funds earned on them to your account if there are more than 200 points in RATING.</p>
				<p>5. When registering and replenishing BALANCE:</p>
				<p>- from 500 to 50,000 YUAN (from 70 to 7000 USD) for each correct collection of QR-ART Puzzle, your RATING will receive from 2 to 6 points and when you reach 200 points per month, your BALANCE will increase by 8%.</p>
				<p>6. The number of games in one day is 5, the number of points in RATING per month is not less than 200. Your points in RATING are reset to zero every 1st day of a new month.</p>
				<p>The client can deposit money to BALANCE only from the 1st to the 10th day of each month; he can withdraw money from BALANCE at any time and any amount.</p>
				<p>1 day >> 5 games >> 1 month >> 200 points in RATING = BALANCE + 8%</p>
